/**
 * Interface representing a node in the category preferences
 * tree.  A category-tree node has three possible states:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>unchecked:  the corresponding category and all of its descendents
 *                     and constraints are not selected (i.e., disabled)</li>
 *     <li>checked:    the corresponding category and all of its descendents
 *                     and constraints are selected (i.e., enabled)</li>
 *     <li>gray-checked: the corresponding category has some descendents and/or
 *                     constraints that are selected and some that are not</li>
 * </ul>
 * Note that internal nodes in the tree never contain constraints and,
 * therefore, their state only reflects the state of their descendent leaf nodes
 * which do contain constraints.  For internal-level categories that do
 * actually have constraints assigned to them, the tree delegates the
 * constraints to a fabricated child node that is a leaf.  This provides
 * separate control of the category hierarchy from the enablement of the
 * constraints in the category.
